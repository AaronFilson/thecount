    <h1>The Count's Super Mega Awesome Counting Song Lyrics</h1>
    <section class="verse1">
      <p>You know that I am called the count</p>
      <p>Because I really love to count</p>
      <p>I could sit and count all day</p>
      <p>Sometimes I get carried away</p>
    </seciton>
    <section class="refrain1">
      <p class="r1line1">I count slowly, slowly, slowly getting faster</p>
      <p>Once I've started counting it's really hard to stop</p>
      <p>Faster, faster. It is so exciting!</p>
      <p>I could count forever, count until I drop</p>
      <p>1! 2! 3! 4!</p>
      <p>1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4,</p>
      <p>1-2, I love counting whatever the ammount haha!</p>
    </seciton>
    <section class="verse2">
      <p>I count the spiders on the wall...</p>
      <p>I count the cobwebs in the hall...</p>
      <p>I count the candles on the shelf...</p>
      <p>When I'm alone, I count myself!</p>
    </seciton>
