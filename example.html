<h1>The Count's  Super Mega Awesome Counting Song Lyrics</h1>
<p>You know that I am called the count</p>
<p>Because I really love to count</p>
<p>I could sit and count all day</p>
<p>Sometimes I get carried away</p>
<p>I count slowly, slowly, slowly getting faster</p>
<p>Once I've started counting it's really hard to stop</p>
<p>Faster, faster. It is so exciting!</p>
<p>I could count forever, count until I drop</p>
<p>1! 2! 3! 4!</p>
<p>1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4,</p>
<p>1-2, i love count ing whatever the ammount haha!</p>
<p>I count the spiders on the wall...</p>
<p>I count the cobwebs in the hall...</p>
<p>I count the candles on the shelf...</p>
<p>When I'm alone, I count myself!</p>
<p>I count slowly, slowly, slowly getting faster</p>
<p>Once I've started counting it's really hard to stop</p>
<p>Faster, faster. It is so exciting!</p>
<p>I could count forever, count until I drop</p>
<p>1! 2! 3! 4!</p>
<p>1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4, 1,2 I love counting whatever the ammount! 1-2-3-4 heyayayay heayayay 1-2-3-4</p>
<p>That's the song of the Count!</p>
