<h1>The $%*#@'s  Super Mega Awesome $%*#@ing Song Lyrics</h1>
<p>You know that I am called the $%*#@</p>
<p>Because I really love to $%*#@</p>
<p>I could sit and $%*#@ all day</p>
<p>Sometimes I get carried away</p>
<p>I $%*#@ slowly, slowly, slowly getting faster</p>
<p>Once I've started $%*#@ing it's really hard to stop</p>
<p>Faster, faster. It is so exciting!</p>
<p>I could $%*#@ forever, $%*#@ until I drop</p>
<p>1! 2! 3! 4!</p>
<p>1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4,</p>
<p>1-2, i love couning whatever the ammount haha!</p>
<p>I $%*#@ the spiders on the wall...</p>
<p>I $%*#@ the cobwebs in the hall...</p>
<p>I $%*#@ the candles on the shelf...</p>
<p>When I'm alone, I $%*#@ myself!</p>
<p>I $%*#@ slowly, slowly, slowly getting faster</p>
<p>Once I've started $%*#@ing it's really hard to stop</p>
<p>Faster, faster. It is so exciting!</p>
<p>I could $%*#@ forever, $%*#@ until I drop</p>
<p>1! 2! 3! 4!</p>
<p>1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4, 1,2 I love $%*#@ing whatever the ammount! 1-2-3-4 heyayayay heayayay 1-2-3-4</p>
